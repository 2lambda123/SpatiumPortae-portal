# Contributing to Portal

We'd love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features

## We use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html) â€” all changes happen through pull requests
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)). We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `develop`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License
In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/SpatiumPortae/portal/issues)
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/SpatiumPortae/portal/issues/new); it's that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code
[This is an example](http://stackoverflow.com/q/12488905/180626) of a good bug report. Try to include as much _relevant_ information as possible. 
Enable the verbose flag with `portal -v ...` and include the `.log`-file, if your bug can be reproduced.

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background.
- Steps to reproduce.
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can.
- What you expected would happen.
- What actually happens.
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work).

## Use a consistent coding style

- Use `gofmt`, easy!
- The `Makefile` has a `lint` target, run `make lint` before commiting!
- Try to follow the general code style of the project. Have a look around the different packages to get a good feel for it!
